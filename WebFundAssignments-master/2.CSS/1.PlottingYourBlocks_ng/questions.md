Trouble understanding the purpose of min-height.
Trouble figuring out where to use vertical align.

The directions: 
"While you do this assignment, please use min-height as well as vertical align to give minimum height to the division and also to vertically align some of the inline-blocks.  Also, please do NOT use float (use display:inline-block instead)."
