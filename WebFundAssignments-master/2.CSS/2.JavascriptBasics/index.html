            <h1> Javascript Basics</h1>
            <p> Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reason. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexiblity for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be conencted to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> 
                  <p>Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span> </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <a href="#">Variable Assignment </a> 
                  <p> Assignment operators values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span> var x=10;</span> </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <a href="#">Data Types </a>
                  <p>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are javascript primitives: Boolean - <span> true</span> or <span> false</span>; null- <span> null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span> 42</span> or <span> 3.14159</span>; String - <span> "Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span>; Array - <span> [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']</span>; and Object - <span> {first_name:'Jane', last_name: "Doe"}</span> </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <a href="#">Conditionals </a> 
                  <p> When you wriet code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span> if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span> else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span> else</span> we execute this block of code; </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <a href="#">Loops </a> 
                  <p>There are many different kinds of loopsin every programming language, but they all essentilly do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop! </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <a href="#">Function </a> 
                  <p>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Dont! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.  </p>
