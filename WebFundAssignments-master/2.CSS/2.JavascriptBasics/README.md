Natasha's Thoughts:
1) The naming of the homework is really confusion. I think it should be names something like: "Web Design: Javascript Home Page Prototyping". Or something that allows for others to know that they will not be learning Javascript during that homework session. 
2) Homework collaboration was really hard for the first week. I do not believe this should be a first week goal when individuals are trying to make sure that they are able to login and understand the cadence of when homework will need to be submitted.
